SWOT Analysis:

Strengths:

Pretty good idea of how I want my app to run, where all of the data will live/render, etc.

Weaknesses:

This unit as a whole was very challenging, I had a hard time following a lot of these topics. Even though I've been able to create other apps and practice certain topics, I still find myself getting lost along the way. Will need to slow down and think about what steps need to be taken to get to my end goal.

Opportunities:

Show off everything I've learned so far in react. I've been practicing CSS a bit more since P1 and want to show off what I've been practicing.

Threats:

Major point of improvement from P1 was time management and not asking for help at the right times. I really pidgeon holed myself the first time around because I tried to complete this project with as minimal help as possible.Do not want to make that mistake again. More than that, just staying on track and letting my timeframes/project schedule and wireframes guide me.
